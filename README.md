# My-Netflix
 
This is a personal project to learn code.

It's a copy of Netflix. The information content is form The Movie Database (TMDB), a public aplication.

The project was made to show my habilities with code and runs Node.js in backend with React in frontend. It receves information from the TMDB public API.

It is responsive and the User interface was designed to be a little different from Netflix, for study purpose.

Today it shows three movie rows, and chosse a random movie to show some info from the API and for the background.
